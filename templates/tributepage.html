    <h1 style="color:white;">Malala Yousafzai Tribute Page</h1>
    <p style="color:white;">Malala Yousafzai, (born July 12, 1997, Mingora, Swat valley, Pakistan), Pakistani activist who, 
    while a teenager, spoke out publicly against the prohibition on the education of girls that was imposed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban
    Pakistan (TTP; sometimes called Pakistani Taliban). She gained global attention when she survived an assassination attempt at 
    age 15. In 2014 Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in recognition of their efforts 
    on behalf of children’s rights.</p>

    <p style="color:white;">On October 9, 2012, Yousafzai was shot in the head by a TTP gunman while she was en route home from school. 
    Fazlullah and the TTP took responsibility for the attempt on her life. She survived the attack and was flown from Peshawar to Birmingham, 
    England, for surgery. The incident elicited protests, and her cause was taken up around the world, including by the UN special envoy for 
    global education, Gordon Brown, who introduced a petition that called for all children around the world to be back in school by 2015. 
    That petition led to the ratification of Pakistan’s first Right to Education bill. In December 2012 Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari 
    announced the launch of a $10 million education fund in Yousafzai’s honour. About the same time, the Malala Fund was established by the Vital 
    Voices Global Partnership to support education for all girls around the world.</p>

    <p style="color:white;">Yousafzai recovered, staying with her family in Birmingham, where she returned to her studies and to activism. 
    For the first time since being shot, she made a public appearance on July 12, 2013, her 16th birthday, and addressed an audience of 500 
    at the United Nations in New York City. Among her many awards, in 2013 Yousafzai won the United Nations Human Rights Prize, awarded every 
    five years. She was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in 2013 and appeared on one of the seven covers that were printed 
    for that issue. With Christina Lamb (foreign correspondent for The Sunday Times), Yousafzai coauthored a memoir, I Am Malala: The Girl Who 
    Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban (2013). She also wrote the picture book Malala’s Magic Pencil (2017), which was based on 
    her childhood. In 2014 she became the youngest person to win the Liberty Medal, awarded by the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia 
    to public figures striving for people’s freedom throughout the world. Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 but passed over that year, 
    Yousafzai in 2014 won the prize, becoming the youngest Nobel laureate.</p>
